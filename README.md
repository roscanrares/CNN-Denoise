# DeepDenoiseCNN üîäüñºÔ∏è  
A deep learning-based approach for **image noise reduction** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## üìå Overview  
DeepDenoiseCNN is a machine learning model designed to remove noise from images by leveraging **deep learning techniques**.  
The model is trained on noisy-clean image pairs and learns to restore the original image quality. 
I developed a denoising algorithm for image preprocessing to enhance object recognition. The object recognition project is available [here](https://github.com/roscanrares/ObjectRecognition)

## Types of Noise Handled
	‚Ä¢	Gaussian Noise ‚Äì Random pixel variations following a Gaussian distribution (commonly found in sensor noise).
	‚Ä¢	Salt & Pepper Noise ‚Äì Random black and white pixels scattered in the image.
	‚Ä¢	Poisson Noise ‚Äì Noise based on Poisson distribution, often appearing in low-light photography or medical imaging.


## Hpw the model works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing: The model loads images and adds artificial noise (if needed).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Training: The neural network learns to transform noisy images into clean ones.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing: The trained model is evaluated on new images to assess its denoising performance.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison with traditional methods: Scikit-learn may be used to analyze results against classical denoising technique
